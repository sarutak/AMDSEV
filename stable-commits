# guest bios
#   An AP creation fix added after the 'edk2-stable202302' tag/release is
#   known to break AP booting on older SNP hypervisor/host kernels based
#   on the 5.19 kernel tree. If you are building packages to be used in
#   conjunction with this older 5.19 level of SNP hypervisor support,
#   please use the 'sev-snp-legacy' branch of this AMDSEV repo instead,
#   which will build the latest known-working QEMU/OVMF trees for older
#   SNP hypervisor/host kernels.
